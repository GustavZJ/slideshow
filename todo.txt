Picture frame:
- Fix issue with images that have had their name changed by the script,
 not being able to load into HTML (This seems to be an issue with the '?' char). ☑

- Fix issue with HTML not being able to display some images, such as .HEIC (This is gonna be annoying) https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2020/12/coping-with-heic-in-the-browser/ ☑
- Consider using jQuery to handle upload errors, so that the error pop up won't appear,
  if the user refreshes, after having attempted to upload images (Need to test if it's possible to get some of the errors thru this method) ☑
- Add indicators to show the user if they have selected too many files ☑

Other (Important):
- Fix post_max_size being out of range (PHP Warning: Invalid "post_max_size" setting. Invalid quantity "4500M": value is out of range, usiing overflow backwards compatibility in Unknown on line 0) ☑

Other (Not very important):
- Add time outs for PHP functions, incase they take too long
- Move some JS and PHP scripts into the src dirs, for consistency ☑
- Change names of variables and such so they use same naming convention
- Do something to avoid confusion about max_image_size input (It shows 'M' in placeholder, but user is not allowed to input it) ☑

Final:
- Testing
